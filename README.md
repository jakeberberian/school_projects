# School Projects

This is a repository for some of the larger projects I did for courses at American University. Each project will be getting its own README, but for now here's a brief description of each.

- **Capital_Bikes**: Final project for the course STAT-627: Statistical Machine Learning. Used data from UCI's Machine Learning Repository to analyze Capital Bikeshare data using multiple linear regression, linear/quadratic discriminant analysis, and random forests. Done in R.
- **Capstone_Weather**: My capstone project for the course MATH-465: Numerical Analysis. Used personal weather station and NOAA data from the area to attempt to find a linear regression function able to "predict" the weather (primarily temperature) around my apartment. Much of the time was spent on data cleaning and wrangling. Written up in Jupyter Notebook. Done in Python. 
- **GPS**: Project for the course MATH-465: Numerical Analysis. Colected personal GPS data (.gpx) for data visualizations and calculations. Outputs a more readable .csv file from .gpx input. Done in Python.
- **NC_Voting**: Final project for the course STAT-615: Regression. Used publically available North Carolina voter data from the 2016 election in an attempt to classify an individual's party affiliation based on other demographics. Implemented multinomial and discriminant analysis. Done in R. 
- **Raytrace**: Project for the course MATH-465: Numerical Analysis. Worked with polynomial curves to compute reflection locations. Worked with a tester. Done in Python.
